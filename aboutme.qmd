Hello, I'm Ian! I'm currently in my third year as a Business Administration student with a specialisation in finance. I'm excited to be taking NM2207 in Semester 1 of the academic year 2023/2024.

In my free time, I'm an avid sports enthusiast, particularly passionate about basketball and football. I proudly support the LA Lakers and enjoy watching their games. I used to enjoy playing basketball as well but I got lazy :)
